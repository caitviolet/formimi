            <h1> i hope you find this. or maybe i don't. wherever you are, i hope you're okay, i hope you're happy.
                where do i begin? there are still so, so many things i want to tell you. things i want you to know,
                and also things i want to hear. i don't think you like me anymore. maybe you don't know how i feel about you.
                for a while, i didn't either.

                but mimi, lately i've been thinking about you all the time. you're in my dreams. i need to think of you to sleep
                at night. i know things are messy, i know things are bad, everything sucks. im happy, but im not.
                i don't like being your enemy, and i feel like an idiot because it appears i've made you mine.
                for the record, i still fucking love you.
                what the hell, sure.

                i know this is a true long shot but i hope one day we will meet again. i hope i find you, and you don't hate me.
                i hope the things we said can remain true.
                i miss you so much.

                am i still your bea?
                if/when you find someone else, i hope you don't forget me. and hey, if that doesn't work out, i hope i still want
                to see you again, and i hope you want to see me too.
                i will write on this website because i cant talk to you. because i shouldn't.

                i am not doing so well, but i did better today. i want to tell you about my day. i really have trouble
                sleeping without you holding onto me.
                im really sorry.
