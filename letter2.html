            <h1> took me one day before i decided to write more. learning how to code, even if it is basic, was crazy from my uni
                because it means i can do gay shit like this. 
                i don't know how i feel about you today. some days i feel like we should go back to being strangers, and maybe today
                is one of them. but tomorow i could miss you all over again.
                i had the crazy idea to message you and ask if we could meet but i know we can't, i know we shouldn't. i lowkey
                don't even want to. but a small part of me really does.
                this isn't easy at all. it's actually only gotten harder.
                we are coming up for the second month post breakup, and it's almost my birthday, and what would have been our
                year anniversary, as well as valentines. its not going to be easy, and i don't want to think about it. 
                febuary was going to be ours. now it's just mine, but i don't want it to be.
                okay, so i think i've figured it out.
                i know i can't go back, ive made my bed and ive got to lie in it, and i wouldn't want beamimi as it was, or as it
                would be right now. i wish it was how it was. so if anything, we could just fall asleep by eachothers sides.
                so i can get a good night sleep again. i can't, maybe one day it'll become easier.
                maybe in a few years the universe would bring us together again. we're so young, so who's to say if we would even
                want to be together again, but i still think of marrying you, which is batshit crazy.
                i think about us living together. cooking food and playing games and living our sweet little life.
                you took control of me at a point where i felt like i couldn't live, and yet i was still okay with that if it
                meant i got your love. maybe once we're both better people.
